# Sentiment-Analysis: 

----------------------------------
A grant is granted free of charge to anyone who obtains a copy of this code and the document files associated with it. People are allowed to use this code, attributed to the author's due credit. This code was developed with the partial support of Prof. Marcelo Otone from UFES (Brazil), whom I thank for the presentation of Python.

The code is academic. This code uses the technique of Loughran and McDonald (2011) for the analysis and measurement of the textual sentiment of news. For more information about the techniques of these authors, I recommend reading their work.
